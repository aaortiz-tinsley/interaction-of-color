# interaction-of-color
An optical grid illusion that explores the interaction of the colors black, white, and gray.


Interaction of Color is a handbook and teaching resource for artists and designers that shares Josef Albersâ€™ theory of color. The text outlines a set of principles and teaching methods for understanding and perceiving color in different ways. 

With Albers in mind, I used p5.js to program an illusion that showcases the interacton of colors. The combination of black, white, and gray trick the eyes into seeing the gray lines as the slightest bit diagnal rather than straight across, as they actually are.
